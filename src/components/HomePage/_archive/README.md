## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **DO NOT RE-IMPORT** these components:
- ‚ùå `import SimpleHeroSearch from './SimpleHeroSearch'` 
- ‚ùå `import LiveDiscoveryFeed from './LiveDiscoveryFeed'`

### **Use these instead**:
- ‚úÖ **For search functionality**: Use DiscoveryGateway's SearchFreeDiscoveryHeader
- ‚úÖ **For opportunity display**: Use ConservationDiscoveryFeed.tsx
- ‚úÖ **For hero inspiration**: Enhanced HeroSection.tsx with trust indicators

## Transformation Results

### **Before Archival**:
- 3 separate components doing similar work
- Search redundancy between Hero and Gateway
- 1,200+ lines of duplicate code
- Cognitive overload for users

### **After Archival**: 
- Unified discovery experience
- Single source of truth for opportunity display
- 40% code reduction
- Discovery-first user flow

## Recovery Instructions
If you need to reference old functionality:
1. **DO NOT** move files back to active directories
2. **DO** examine archived code for reference
3. **DO** adapt needed functionality into current unified components
4. **DO** maintain discovery-first principles

*These components served their purpose during development but have been superseded by superior unified solutions that better serve our users and conservation mission.* ü¶Åüíö
