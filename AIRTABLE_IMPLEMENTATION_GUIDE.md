# üóÉÔ∏è Airtable Implementation Guide
*The Animal Side - Complete Airtable Base Architecture*

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

This guide translates The Animal Side's PostgreSQL schema into **Airtable's no-code database structure**. Airtable provides excellent prototyping capabilities with built-in forms, views, and API access while maintaining relational data integrity.

### **Airtable Advantages for Wildlife Conservation Platform**
- **Rapid prototyping** - No database setup required
- **Built-in forms** - Contact and application forms automatically generated
- **Visual interface** - Non-technical team members can manage data
- **Automatic API** - REST API generated for all tables
- **Rich field types** - Attachments, ratings, formulas, lookups
- **Collaboration features** - Comments, real-time editing, permissions

### **Architecture Adaptation Strategy**
- **Single Airtable Base** with multiple tables (vs. PostgreSQL database)
- **Linked Records** instead of foreign keys
- **Formula Fields** for calculated values
- **Views** for filtered data sets
- **Automations** for workflow management
