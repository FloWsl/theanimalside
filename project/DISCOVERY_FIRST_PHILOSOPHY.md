# üåø Discovery-First Design Philosophy - The Animal Side

## Core Philosophy: Inspiration Before Action

**"Let users fall in love with conservation before asking them to commit."**

The Animal Side prioritizes **visual discovery and emotional connection** over immediate search and conversion. Users should feel inspired, educated, and emotionally connected to wildlife conservation before being asked to take specific actions.
