### Architectural Changes

The StoriesTab has been completely redesigned to follow industry standards:

**Before (Archived)**:

3. **Eliminated Duplication**: PhotoGallery remains only in ExperienceTab
4. **Improved UX**: Clean, scannable interface vs overwhelming content

### Migration Path

If old functionality needs to be restored:
1. Components remain in _archive/ directory

4. Not recommended due to UX issues resolved
