# OrganizationDetail Component Archive

## üìÅ Archived Components

This directory contains React components that were previously part of the OrganizationDetail system but have been replaced by the new **tab-based discovery architecture** implemented on **June 3, 2025**.

### üóÉÔ∏è Archived Files:

1. **AnimalPhotoGallery.tsx** - Replaced by `tabs/ExperienceTab.tsx`
2. **ApplicationSection.tsx** - Replaced by `tabs/ConnectTab.tsx`
3. **EssentialInfoSidebar.tsx** - Replaced by `tabs/OverviewTab.tsx` and `tabs/PracticalTab.tsx`

8. **TestimonialsSection.tsx** - Replaced by `tabs/StoriesTab.tsx`

### üöÄ Reasons for Archival:

#### **Old System Issues:**
- **Linear Content Flow**: 5000+ word single-page experience causing cognitive overload
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Not optimized for mobile-first discovery
- **Information Silos**: Content scattered across multiple components without clear hierarchy
- **Conversion-Heavy Language**: Contradicted discovery-first philosophy

#### **New Tab System Benefits:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users can explore information at their own pace
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Tab navigation perfect for touch devices
- **Clear Information Architecture**: Overview ‚Üí Experience ‚Üí Practical ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Connect
- **Discovery-First Language**: Factual, trust-building content over emotional manipulation

### üìã Still Active Components:

The following components continue to be used in the new system:
- `OrganizationHeader.tsx` - Enhanced for tab system
- `ProgramSelector.tsx` - For organizations with multiple programs  
- `TabNavigation.tsx` - New tab navigation system
- `tabs/` directory - All new tab-based components

### üîÑ Recovery Instructions:

If you need to reference or restore any archived component:

1. **Review Purpose**: Check if the functionality exists in the new tab system
2. **Extract Code**: Copy relevant code snippets to appropriate tab components
3. **Test Integration**: Ensure compatibility with new architecture
4. **Update Dependencies**: All imports and type definitions may need updates

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- **Do not delete** these files - they contain valuable component logic that might be needed for reference
- **Do not import** these components in the current system - they will cause conflicts
- **Consider them read-only** reference materials for understanding the evolution of the system
